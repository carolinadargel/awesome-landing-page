                                    It's where the dance was born in the bordellos and immigrant neighborhoods in 
                                    the late 1800s. The tango is improvised, aggressive and erotic. Every move 
                                    symbolizes el amor y la passion -- love and passion.                       
                                    But if you want to see the real tango you have to get away from 
                                    the tourist spots. This is something you have to see!</p>

                            Going to South America was the most wonderful experience I could ever had. 
                            I was planning on staying a few days, but I got to stay longer becausethere were so much to 
                            see. After coming back home I couldn't help but tell everyone about the 
                            amazing trip I had.
